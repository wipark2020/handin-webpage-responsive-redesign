  <h1>Redesigning FifaAddict</h1>

  <div class="topic">
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>FIFAaddict is a useful tool for the video game FIFA Online 4 which is a free-to-play multiplayer football (soccer) game.

    <h2>Redesign Reason:</h2>
    <p>I chose to redesign FIFAaddict because I am an active player of the video game. I have not used this website before but heard about it from friends. When I first expereinced the website, I noticed that this website's user experience is bothered with the design of the homepage. Navigating the homepage easier will improve the amount of people using the product and allow players to effectively use the website to the best of its ability.</p>

    <h2>Problems Identified:</h2>

    <div class="problem-list">
      <h3>Usability issues found:</h3>
      <p>The following are usability issues found: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The website does not have a clear visual hierarchy as the site has a lot going on visually where it could benefit from emphasizing information, not allowing the user to strategically guide the user's attention.</li>
        <li>It does not have a common scan pattern such as ‘F’ or ‘Z’ pattern where a more structured layout could help in improving the navigation since the interface is so cluttered</li>
        <li>The color and layout also do not help in distinguishing the different sections so utilizing more color could help in organizing the layout</li>
        <li>The site could also utilize some gestalt principles where grouping similar items could be more grouped together such as buttons</li>
        <li>There is too much on the home page that makes it difficult to follow where one feature starts or ends</li>
        <li>The links at the top of the page are unknown of what they are so it is hard to navigate the website</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Accessibility issues found:</h3>
      <p>The following are accessibility issues found from the WebAIM analysis (iamge above) which shows the accessibility problems of the website: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Color contrast is a big problem where the problem is “very low contrast” which makes it hard to see the features</li>
        <li>Although aria labels are used, alternative text is missing which make it hard for users with screen readers to use the webpage.</li>
        <li>The text size made it difficult to read as well</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>Most of the problems come from the cluttering of the homepage where there were too many features present in the home screen to notify new users where to navigate or how to easily use the website. 
        My goals:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Highlight the main feature of the website which is the search bar and the results which are the players</li>
          <li>Separate the other features and link those to different home pages via links</li>
          <li>Update the color contrasts and add accessibility features</li>
          <li>Increase text size</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have implemented these goals through sketches, lo-fi, and hi-fi designs to end up with the responsive redesign. </p>

    <p>After creating the lo-fi wireframe and deciding that that is the design I am going for, I have decided to create some components, color, and type choices to ensure that I follow good design practices.</p>
